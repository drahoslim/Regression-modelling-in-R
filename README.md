# Regression-modelling-in-R
Conducting regression analysis on two datasets separately: Canadian housing prices in CAD and U.S. citizensâ€™ wage data in USD. The second document contains data about Italian startups. Both coding files stem from a school project, code commentary provided in Czech language. In the first document, to describe the dataset I used a classion linear regression model, in the second file I create other types of econometric models such as logistic regression model to model the odds ratio.

## This project demonstrates my ability to load data and create a regression models and perform further regression analysis, and test hypotheses using R. Then I present results in as a text.

The work included:
- loading the data
- tranforming the data so it fits the analysis
- creating a meaningful regression model
- test hypotheses
- to reject (or not reject) a statistical hypothesis
- assess the results

**I am aware that this project lacks actual impact it would have had for the stakeholder, as this was merely a school exercise. Due to this matter, the datasets are not available for public as they are a school property, I am only allowed to share my code and its related commentary, not the dataset or the final "essay".**
